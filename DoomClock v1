# TO IMPLEMENT: age breakdown (18-05-1994) for better accuracy, clock ticking down, country life expectancy, BMI life expectancy (integrate BMI calc?)

age = input("What is your current age? ")

expectancy = 90
age_left = expectancy - int(age)

months = age_left * 12
weeks = age_left * 52
days = age_left * 365

print(f"Given a {expectancy}-year life expectancy, you have around {days} days, {weeks} weeks, or {months} months left. Enjoy it.")
